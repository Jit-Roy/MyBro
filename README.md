# MyBro - An AI To Help You Get Rid Of Depression

*"Sometimes you need someone who fights for you when you can't fight for yourself."*

![MyBro Architecture](docs/image.png)

A compassionate AI chatbot designed to provide mental health support with genuine human-like responses. Built with Python, LangChain, and Google's Gemini API.

## 🎯 **What Makes MyBro Different?**

Unlike clinical chatbots that just ask questions, MyBro responds like a **caring older brother** who:
- **Fights for you** when you're feeling down
- **Challenges negative thoughts** with passion and protection
- **Gives you reasons to live** instead of just listening passively
- **Shows real emotion** and urgency about your wellbeing
- **Protects you from your own dark thoughts**
